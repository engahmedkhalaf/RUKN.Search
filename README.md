# RUKN Search - Select by Revit ID

**RUKN Search - Select by Revit ID** is a powerful, free add-in for Autodesk® Navisworks® that allows users to quickly locate and select model elements using their original Revit Element IDs.

---

## Key Features

* **Quick Element Selection:** Locate any Revit element inside Navisworks in seconds.
* **Bulk Selection:** Select multiple elements at once by entering comma-separated IDs (e.g., `102435, 102436, 102440`).
* **Validation & UI Feedback:** Built-in verification warns you if a Revit model is not loaded or if an invalid ID is entered.
* **Ribbon Integration:** Adds a dedicated, easy-to-access **RUKN Search** tab to the Autodesk Navisworks ribbon.

## How It Works

Autodesk Navisworks stores original Revit Element IDs within the internal property attributes. This add-in programmatically queries the property `LcRevitId` (found in the `LcOaNat64AttributeValue` category) across all elements in the active document and matches them against user input to select them.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Open your model:** Load a Revit model (NWC/NWD) in Autodesk Navisworks.
2. **Launch the Add-in:** Navigate to the **RUKN Search** tab on the Navisworks Ribbon and click the **RUKN Search - Select by ID** button.
3. **Enter Revit IDs:** Paste a single Revit Element ID or multiple comma-separated IDs into the text box.
4. **Select:** Click **Select**. The corresponding elements will immediately be highlighted and selected in your Navisworks workspace.
